## Ray

Show Name: Happenstance <br>
DOB: May 1, 2005 <br>
Dutch Warmblood/Appendix Quarter Horse Gelding

Also known as "Ray Ray", "Ray-dough" and "Lerato" , Ray is a hilarious ridiculous old man who is quite particular about his life and has enough opinions to rival a mare. A former show jumper, he now is doing low level dressage and sometimes dabbles in other flat disciplines. Ray is passionate about food and loves rolling in the dirt, monitoring his mares, making mares squeal and treat stretches (or anything with a treat, really).

## Athena

Khantefina <br>
April 2017 <br>
Holsteiner Mare

Inexplicably also known as "Bean", "Beana" and "Athena Bean", Athena is a mostly quiet mare who's main thought in life is forage but is strangely picky about treats. Currently an effective hay vacuum, she is training to be a jumping bean but thinks her main job is cleaning everyone's hay! She's also the boss of Vegas.

## Bambee

AA Awesome Bambee <br>
2002 <br>
POA (Pony of Americas) Mare

Mostly known as Bams, Bambee is famous for playing hard and sleeping hard and looking absolutely adorable while doing it! Having spent her life as a school pony, Bambee is pony extraordinaire with kids of all levels. She loves playing with Ray like crazy seniors and long naps.

## Vegas

2002 Mare

Vegas is our retired boarder, but is part of the family and our homemade herd. She is a big, quiet, gentle girl. She is friends with Athena (although they don't admit it) and tolerates Ray (she hated him until a heat cycle made him handsome!) but is rather picky on who she accepts as a friend. Vegas embraces the retired life and loves long naps in the field.
